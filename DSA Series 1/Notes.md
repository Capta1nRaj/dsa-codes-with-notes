# 1. What is Data Structure?

It is a way to organize data, so that, we can use that data in an efficient manner.

# 2. Types of Data Structure:-

There are 2 types of DS:-

- (i.) Primitive DS:- Basic types of data.
- (ii.) Non-Primitive DS.

## There are 4 types of Primitive DS:-

- (i.) Integer
- (ii.) Float
- (iii.) Character
- (iv.) Pointer

## There are 3 types of Non-Primitive DS:-

- (i.) Array
- (ii.) Lists
- (iii.) Files

### There are 2 types of List:-

- (i.) Linear List:- It is of 2 types Stacks, & Queues. In Linear List, operation can be performed on starting or ending of the array, you can't perform any operation in between.
- (ii.) Non-Linear List:- It is of 2 types Graphs, & Trees. In Non-linear List, operation can be performed from any point of the array.

# Operations of DS:-

- (i.) Traversal:- It means to just check/read the data.
- (ii.) Insertion:- Inserting a value in the data.
- (iii.) Deletion:- Deleting a value in the data.
- (iv.) Searching:- Searching a value in the data.
- (v.) Sorting:- Sorting the data.
- (vi.) Merging:- Merging 2 data in one.

# 3. Types & Operations of DS we will study:-

- (i.) Array
- (ii.) Stack
- (iii.) Queue
- (iv.) Tree
- (v.) Graph
- (vi.) Insertion
- (vii.) Recursion
- (viii.) Search
- (ix.) Sorting
- (x.) Merge
- (xi.) Map
- (xii.) Set

## 4. Studied:-

- Array traversion in video_2_array_traversion.html.
- Insert a value in an array in video_3_insert_a_value_in_array.html.
